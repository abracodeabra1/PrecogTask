# Precog Recruitment Task
This README file provides instructions for running the code and required libraries for the task code submission.

## Directory Structure

There are three main files, Task_A, Task_B, and Bonus, inside which you will find the respective python notebooks for each task.
Also, in the main directory you will the Report.

## Instructions for Running python files
The main code for this assignment is located in the 7 files:
- a_1.ipynb
- a_2.ipynb
- b_1.ipynb
- b_2.ipynb
- bonus_1.ipynb
- bonus_2_1.ipynb
- bonus_2_2.ipynb

The Task Report can be found as the "Task_Report.pdf" file.

To run the .ipynb scripts, open the Python notebook and run the codes.


## Required Libraries
Before running the provided code, please make sure the following Python libraries are installed on your system:

- numpy
- SentenceTransformers
- fasttext
- nltk
- spacy
- transformers 
- datasets
- google.generativeai 
- spacy_universal_sentence_encoder

You can install any missing libraries using the following command (replace **<library_name>** with the library you want to install):

```
pip install <library_name>
```

The run procedure is quite similar for all codes, as they are python notebooks.
In most of the notebooks, on running the code, the required datasets will be automatically downloaded. If not, the error message will prompt you to download it.
